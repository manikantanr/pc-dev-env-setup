#  Development Environment Setup

The scripts and commands I use to configure my fresh Linux and Windows development environments


# Windows 10/11

In Linux I use apt or yum to install almost all the required apps. In Windows, we can use  [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org) to do similar job.

But I want use latest windows tool, [WinGet](https://winget.run/).

## Installation of winget and winget pacakges

Visit https://winget.run/ and click on `Install winget` link on the navbar.

Once winget is installed use the following commands to install packages.


```bash

```
